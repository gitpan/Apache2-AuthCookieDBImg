=head1 NAME

Apache2::AuthCookieDBImg

=head1 PURPOSE

An AuthCookie module backed by a DBI database with second level
authentication via image matching.  This is very simple image
authentication scheme that is only meant to prevent robotic
logins to a web page by adding a 2nd level of authentication.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is an authentication handler that uses the basic mechanism provided
by Apache2::AuthCookie with a DBI database for ticket-based protection.  It
is based on two tokens being provided, a username and password, which can
be any strings (there are no illegal characters for either).  The username is
used to set the remote user as if Basic Authentication was used.

On an attempt to access a protected location without a valid cookie being
provided, the module prints an HTML login form (produced by a CGI or any
other handler; this can be a static file if you want to always send people
to the same entry page when they log in).  This login form has fields for
username and password.  On submitting it, the username and password are looked
up in the DBI database.  The supplied password is checked against the password
in the database; the password in the database can be plaintext, or a crypt()
or md5_hex() checksum of the password.  If this succeeds, the user is issued
a ticket.  This ticket contains the username, an issue time, an expire time,
and an MD5 checksum of those and a secret key for the server.  It can
optionally be encrypted before returning it to the client in the cookie;
encryption is only useful for preventing the client from seeing the expire
time.  If you wish to protect passwords in transport, use an SSL-encrypted
connection.  The ticket is given in a cookie that the browser stores.

After a login the user is redirected to the location they originally wished
to view (or to a fixed page if the login "script" was really a static file).

On this access and any subsequent attempt to access a protected document, the
browser returns the ticket to the server.  The server unencrypts it if
encrypted tickets are enabled, then extracts the username, issue time, expire
time and checksum.  A new checksum is calculated of the username, issue time,
expire time and the secret key again; if it agrees with the checksum that
the client supplied, we know that the data has not been tampered with.  We
next check that the expire time has not passed.  If not, the ticket is still
good, so we set the username.

Authorization checks then check that any "require valid-user" or "require
user jacob" settings are passed.  Finally, if a "require group foo" directive
was given, the module will look up the username in a groups database and
check that the user is a member of one of the groups listed.  If all these
checks pass, the document requested is displayed.

If a ticket has expired or is otherwise invalid it is cleared in the browser
and the login form is shown again.

IMAGE MATCHING

The image matching only occurs if all 3 of the following directives appear
in the Apache configuration file:
    PerlSetVar WhatEverDBI_ImgTable 		"images"
    PerlSetVar WhatEverDBI_ImgWordField 	"imageword"
    PerlSetVar WhatEverDBI_ImgKeyField 	"imagekey"

The first ImgTable var is the DBI table that we will use to store our
image key + word pairs.   The key field is set by the second var, the word
is the third var.

Your login form should set the 2  required fields for ALL AuthCookieDBI
login forms:
Your login ID: <input type="text" name="credential_0" value="">
Your password: <input type="password" name="credential_1" value="">

PLUS two additional fields for image processing:
The image says: <input type="text" name="credential_2" value="">
<input type="hidden" name="credential_3" value="a_random_key">

The login form should also have an image displayed that shows the word
that we are expecting to receive via credential_2 as semi-obscured text.
Typically the image that is displayed is selected at random (provide
your own image randomizer here) with the hidden credential_3 field
also being set via the same random selector so that we can lookup
the word in the images table via the key we get in credential_3.

For example, my randomizer (written in perl and called via a perl 
page template processor similar to Template::Toolkit) will spit out
my image coding and hidden field coding into my HTML page selecting
a random image + key from the images table.  For example, the output
from my perl randomizer spits out:
<img src="/images/dbimg/junk.png"><input type="hidden" name="credential_3" value="1">

To make the work of the randomizer easier I create my images table
like this:
create table images ( imagekey serial, imageurl char(128), imageword char(20));

And load it up like this:
inssert into images (imageurl,imageword) values ('/images/dbimg/junk.png','saywhat?');

Then create an image named junk.png and put it in my web server /images/dbimg folder.
The text on the image has a background picture plus the word "saywhat?" across the front.

The randomizer just looks up the imageurl and imagekey in the database and spits out
the appropriate HTML code.   ApacheCookieDBImg then does a reverse operation, looking
up the imageword based on the key.

=head1 CAVEATS

This is not a truly random image, so it is not overly secure.  The initial idea is just
to thwart stupid bots.   Someone could easily visit the site and build a map of image
sources and the matching words.  i.e. when credential_3 == 1 the word is always "saywhat?".

Not fool-proof, just and extra level of bot protection.

=head1 APACHE CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES

All configuration directives for this module are passed in PerlSetVars.  These
PerlSetVars must begin with the AuthName that you are describing, so if your
AuthName is PrivateBankingSystem they will look like:

    PerlSetVar PrivateBankingSystemDBI_DSN "DBI:mysql:database=banking"

See also L<Apache2::Authcookie> for the directives required for any kind
of Apache2::AuthCookie-based authentication system.

In the following descriptions, replace "WhatEver" with your particular
AuthName.  The available configuration directives are as follows:

=over 4

=item C<WhatEverDBI_DSN>

Specifies the DSN for DBI for the database you wish to connect to retrieve
user information.  This is required and has no default value.

=item C<WhateverDBI_SecretKey>

Specifies the secret key for this auth scheme.  This should be a long
random string.  This should be secret; either make the httpd.conf file
only readable by root, or put the PerlSetVar in a file only readable by
root and include it.

This is required and has no default value.
(NOTE: In AuthCookieDBImg versions 1.22 and earlier the secret key either could be
or was required to be in a seperate file with the path configured with
PerlSetVar WhateverDBI_SecretKeyFile, as of version 2.0 this is not possible, you
must put the secret key in the Apache configuration directly, either in the main
httpd.conf file or in an included file.  You might wish to make the file not
world-readable. Also, make sure that the Perl environment variables are
not publically available, for example via the /perl-status handler.)
See also L</"COMPATIBILITY"> in this man page.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_User>

The user to log into the database as.  This is not required and
defaults to undef.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_Password>

The password to use to access the database.  This is not required
and defaults to undef.

Make sure that the Perl environment variables are
not publically available, for example via the /perl-status handler since the
password could be exposed.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_UsersTable>

The table that user names and passwords are stored in.  This is not
required and defaults to 'users'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_UserField>

The field in the above table that has the user name.  This is not
required and defaults to 'user'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_PasswordField>

The field in the above table that has the password.  This is not
required and defaults to 'password'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_CryptType>

What kind of hashing is used on the password field in the database.  This can
be 'none', 'crypt', or 'md5'.  This is not required and defaults to 'none'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_GroupsTable>

The table that has the user / group information.  This is not required and
defaults to 'groups'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_GroupField>

The field in the above table that has the group name.  This is not required
and defaults to 'grp' (to prevent conflicts with the SQL reserved word 'group').

=item C<WhatEverDBI_GroupUserField>

The field in the above table that has the user name.  This is not required
and defaults to 'user'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_ImgTable>

The table that has the image to word mapping information.  This is not required and
defaults to 'groups'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_GroupField>

The field in the above table that has the group name.  This is not required
and defaults to 'grp' (to prevent conflicts with the SQL reserved word 'group').

=item C<WhatEverDBI_GroupUserField>

The field in the above table that has the user name.  This is not required
and defaults to 'user'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_EncryptionType>

What kind of encryption to use to prevent the user from looking at the fields
in the ticket we give them.  This is almost completely useless, so don''t
switch it on unless you really know you need it.  It does not provide any
protection of the password in transport; use SSL for that.  It can be 'none',
'des', 'idea', 'blowfish', or 'blowfish_pp'.

This is not required and defaults to 'none'.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_SessionLifetime>

How long tickets are good for after being issued.  Note that presently
Apache2::AuthCookie does not set a client-side expire time, which means that
most clients will only keep the cookie until the user quits the browser.
However, if you wish to force people to log in again sooner than that, set
this value.  This can be 'forever' or a life time specified as:

    DD-hh-mm-ss -- Days, hours, minute and seconds to live.

This is not required and defaults to '00-24-00-00' or 24 hours.

=item C<WhatEverDBI_SessionModule>

Which Apache2::Session module to use for persistent sessions.
For example, a value could be "Apache2::Session::MySQL".  The DSN will
be the same as used for authentication.  The session created will be
stored in $r->pnotes( WhatEver ).

If you use this, you should put:

    PerlModule Apache2::Session::MySQL

(or whatever the name of your session module is) in your httpd.conf file,
so it is loaded.

If you are using this directive, you can timeout a session on the server side
by deleting the user''s session.  Authentication will then fail for them.

This is not required and defaults to none, meaning no session objects will
be created.

=head1 DATABASE SCHEMAS

For this module to work, the database tables must be laid out at least somewhat
according to the following rules:  the user field must be a primary key
so there is only one row per user; the password field must be NOT NULL.  If
you're using MD5 passwords the password field must be 32 characters long to
allow enough space for the output of md5_hex().  If you're using crypt()
passwords you need to allow 13 characters.

An minimal CREATE TABLE statement might look like:

    CREATE TABLE users (
        user VARCHAR(16) PRIMARY KEY,
        password VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL
    )

For the groups table, the access table is actually going to be a join table
between the users table and a table in which there is one row per group
if you have more per-group data to store; if all you care about is group
membership though, you only need this one table.  The only constraints on
this table are that the user and group fields be NOT NULL.

A minimal CREATE TABLE statement might look like:

    CREATE TABLE groups (
        grp VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL,
        user VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL
    )
